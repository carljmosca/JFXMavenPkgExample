This is an example JavaFX application which utilizes FXML, is in maven format, and includes packaging via the javafxpackager.

Required:
 
 - Java 1.7.0_06+ (currently pre-release but required for javafxpackager if using Java 7)
 - a file generated with keytool named javafx.ks in a directory named keystore which should be located in the users home directory

    Example creation:

        keytool -genkey -keystore javafx.ks -alias javafx
        keytool -selfcert -alias javafx -keystore javafx.ks

Notes:

The better part of this example came from Andy Moncsek's demo pom file.
The primary issue I ran into, was getting the example to run/debug from
within my IDE, in this case NetBeans 7.2.  I thought it was a maven issue
until I realized the example runs from the command line after a successful build
from the IDE or command line.  Next I thought it was a NetBeans issue.  Ultimately
I realized NetBeans could not find the JavaFX runtime when it launches the program.
I solved it by adding a symbolic link to jfxrt.jar in the extensions directory.

on OS X from /Library/Java/Extensions
ln -s /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7/Contents/Home/jre/lib/jfxrt.jar .
